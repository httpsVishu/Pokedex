# Pokedex

Welcome to the Pokedex!

This project is a small web app inspired by the original Pokemon Pokedex, where you can look up Pokemon and see their basic details. It is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and uses real Pokemon data fetched from pokeAPI.

The idea was simple: make something fun while learning how data flows from an API to the screen :)

# What you can do

- Search for Pokemon by name or Pokedex number
- Browse Pokemon like a digital Pokedex
- View details such as Pokemon image, type and stats
- Use it directly in the browser, no setup required (thank me later)

# How to use it

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/httpsVishu/Pokedex.git
```
2. Open the folder
3. Open index.html in your browser
4. Start catching Pokémon (virtually 😄)

# Future improvements

- Better UI and animations
- Filter Pokemon by type
- Pagination or infinite scrolling
- Mobile-first design improvements
